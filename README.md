# Simple_Calculator_w_Currency_Converter
Simple calculator implemented with fixer.io in order for the Result to be able to be converted at USD, GBP and AUD

I developed that project because I was asked during a job interview process.
This is my first ever solo android project so If you find any mistakes regarding appearance or coding itself, feel free to inform me.

For the time being you can only convert the result of a 2 input calculator only to USD, GBP AUD.


In order to make it work:

i) Go to https://fixer.io/documentation

ii) Press the get a free API key button

iii) Subscribe on the free plan that allows you to make 100 calls of the Api for free

iv) Copy your API key

v) Paste your API key at line:29 in Main_Activity.java

vi) Use it
